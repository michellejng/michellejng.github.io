In 2020, the world has been on fire.  But I’m still not ready for my time on earth to end.

Before I die, I want to design products, and ultimately organizations, that outlive me, and I want to do so by recentering values in production pipelines.

Although as individuals, we are driven largely by our values—what we consider to be good, right, or true—the companies creating all our goods and services are driven primarily by profit.  That gap between personal and corporate KPIs destines us for dissatisfaction—and worse, self-destruction.  Global warming, and the pollution that caused it, are only the most compelling recent consequences of corporate greed.

I don't think respecting values and driving profit have to be mutually exclusive.  But I see many companies struggle to define values with quantifiable impact. Working toward a vague goal without clear KPIs framing it is challenging, like building a house without knowing whether to use brick or concrete.


By reimagining value-imbued systems that drive profit while also prioritizing things that individuals truly care about, I believe we can create products that better serve their users.  This framework is one I have begun to develop with Zylem, my B2B reusable utensil nonprofit, and one I hope to champion wherever I go.

With values in mind, whether they center mental health or the environment, we will be able to build truly equitable systems. And after equity, longevity closely follows.

If I can achieve that, wherever I am, I will have left the impact I desired.
