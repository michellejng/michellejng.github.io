A giant plush Totoro, hiding under his fuki leaf—this was what my younger sister wanted for her 10th birthday.  At 13, I was determined to save up the money to buy it for her.

I knew almost nothing about photography, but when I saw a high-salary listing for a professional photographer, I took a few shots with my secondhand camera, applied rough editing I learned  from the Internet, and sent in my portfolio. Impressed by my confidence at our interview, my boss hired me on the spot, and I earned my first freelance job as an ad hoc wedding photographer to the tune of several thousand dollars.

Since my first job, I’ve worked a number of other freelance positions as a writer, editor, and consultant, but my photography work was the first time I realized the power of confidence: that if I believed in myself, other people would believe in me, too. It was this mentality that led me, at only 18, to book my own list of clients at a luxury branding consultancy. It is the reason I will be graduating with a computer science degree, even though I got Cs in my first CS classes, and the reason I was able to part-time intern on Apple’s Machine Learning team this past summer, even though I was only hired to work on the Bluetooth team.

I learned it from Totoro: no matter how bad I am at something initially, if I put enough time into it, I can succeed.
