#Answering personal question 1
In 2020, it truly feels like the world has been on fire.  But I’m still not ready for my time on earth to end.

Before I die, I want to design products, and ultimately organizations, that outlive me, and I want to do so by redefining where we find value in the XX pipeline.

Although as individuals, we are driven largely by our values—what we consider to be good, right, or true—the companies on whom we rely for all our goods and services are driven primarily by profit.  That gap between personal and corporate KPIs destines us for dissatisfaction—and worse, self-destruction.  Global warming, and the pollution that caused it, are only the most compelling recent consequences of corporate greed.  If we don’t recenter XX as a driving force in business models soon, it will not only be our environment that hangs in the balance, but indeed our world.

With Zylem, my B2B reusable straw nonprofit, I’ve already made an effort to create a value-centered organization, one driven to center sustainability in the manufacturing supply chain.  I want to bring this way of thinking to every place I work.  By reimagining value-imbued systems that allow for profit while also prioritizing things that individuals truly care about, I believe we can create true sustainability. We will not only be protecting our planet, but creating products and organizations that will weather the next few hundred years, and in doing so protecting people—those whom we love now, and those who will come after us.
